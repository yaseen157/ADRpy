    "Before pressing this model into service, we need to clarify some of its notations, limitations and assumptions.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, the velocities. The calculations above assume zero wind. This means that we can just talk about 'speed' without specifying whether that mean *ground speed* in the inertial terms and *true airspeed* in the aerodynamic terms.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, the aerodynamic coefficients. $C_\\mathrm{D}^\\mathrm{TO}$ and $C_\\mathrm{L}^\\mathrm{TO}$ are the drag and lift coefficient values for the aircraft rolling along the runway, in take-off configuration (landing gear and take-off flaps down), wing in ground effect.\n",
    "\n",
    "Further, the calculations set out above are based on the approximation that at the speed $V_\\mathrm{L}$ in this take-off configuration and with wheels still on the ground, the net lift generated by the aircraft is equal to its weight. A moment later, when rotation occurs, everything will change as the angle of attack increases: the aircraft will generate more drag, but also more lift; as the lift exceeds the weight of the aircraft, a positive vertical acceleration will result as the wheels leave the ground.\n",
    "\n",
    "$S_\\mathrm{ref}$ is the reference area of the wing, with respect to which $C_\\mathrm{D}^\\mathrm{TO}$ and $C_\\mathrm{L}^\\mathrm{TO}$ are defined. In general, this is the planform (projected) area of the wing, though there are subtle differences in how this is calculated. The source of the variety of approaches here is that, on most aircraft, the low pressure areas above the two wings join together over the fuselage, so it makes sense to include into the area accounting some type of virtual extension of the wings up to the centreline of the aircraft. At this early stage in the design process we shall consider a simple trapeze planform, but it is important to be aware of the different methods used by different aircraft manufacturers when using their wing area (or lift/drag coefficient) data. For example, the wing area of Boeing aircraft is generally quoted using the *Wimpress method* (named after former chief aerodynamicist John K. Wimpress).\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, a comment on the weight. $W$ in the equations above is clearly a *force*, but the fact that 'take-off weight' is almost always quoted in units of mass (typically kg, lbs, or tonnes) may confuse matters. Such numbers have to be converted into units of force when using these equations."

    "The service ceiling of an aircraft is defined as the maximum altitude at which the aircraft is able to attain a specified minimal rate of climb - usually 100fpm (0.508m/s) -- when flying at best climbing speed. This means that we can simply use the rate of climb constraint formulation here too, with the caveat that the accuracy of the ceiling constraint calculation depends on our estimate of the best climb speed. \n",

    "Estimates can be obtained using `AircraftConcept.get_bestV_Y`, however, when applied to aircraft reverse engineered with this library, these can be significantly different to the published speeds in the pilot's operating handbook.\n",

It requires two additional `designbrief` entries: `servceil_m` (the required service ceiling in metres) and `secclimbspd_kias` (the best indicated airspeed for climb to the service ceiling)."
