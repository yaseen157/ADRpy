ADRpy is an academic, teaching resource containing aircraft conceptual design
and performance analysis tools such as:

- Virtual (design) atmospheres
- Constraint analysis methods
- Propulsion system performance models
- Unit conversion functions
- *and much more...*

For a detailed description of the library, please consult the
[Documentation](https://adrpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). To get started,
follow the instructions below.

For video tutorials and explainers (a.k.a. *ADRpy Shorts*) scroll to the bottom
of this page.

Components of this library are written to be both easy to read and modify
without requiring significant coding knowledge.

## Installation

ADRpy is written in Python 3 and tested in Python version 3.9.

*It is not available for Python 2.*

### Using the Python Package Index

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **WARNING**: The latest version of ADRpy available using this method is
> version 0.2.x, which is not the version in this repository (version 0.3.0).
> They are not compatible, and this section is here for reference only. If you'd
> like to install ADRpy 0.3.0, *do not use the Python Package Index*, and
> instead follow the instructions written for using git to clone the repository,
> or manually downloading the source (see below).

On most systems you should be able to simply open an operating system terminal
and at the command prompt type

    $ pip install -e ADRpy

or

    $ python -m pip install -e ADRpy

NOTE: the `-e` flag is optional, but recommended. It makes the ADRpy install
*editable*, allowing users to poke and prod the machinery of the library.

NOTE: `pip` is a Python package; if it is not available on your system, download
[get-pip.py](https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py) and run it in Python by
entering

    $ python get-pip.py

at the operating system prompt.

### Using git clone

An alternative approach to installing ADRpy is to clone the GitHub repository,
by typing

    $ git clone https://github.com/yaseen157/ADRpy.git

at the command prompt and then executing the setup file in the same directory by
entering:

    $ python setup.py install

### Installing from Source using `pip`

At the top of the GitHub page is a green `Code` dropdown.
Download the .zip file and unpackage ADRpy into a directory you'd like to
install it into.

Start a command prompt window at this location, and enter the ADRpy directory:

    $ cd ./ADRpy

When you are in the ADRpy root folder, you can type the following to install
ADRpy:

    $ pip install -e ./

Notice that unlike the previous pip instructions that specified the library
name (which tells pip to look in the cloud for the ADRpy library), using `./`
tells pip to make an (optionally editable, with`-e`) install of the library
source code that it finds inside the folder you're in.

### Uninstalling with `pip`

Sorry to see you go! Open a command prompt anywhere in your ADRpy enabled
Python environment. You don't need to navigate to a specific folder to uninstall
ADRpy, as pip already knows where ADRpy lives on your machine. Type as follows:

    $ pip uninstall ADRpy -y

Which tells pip to uninstall any package on your machine it knows to be called
ADRpy, and uses the optional flag `-y` to answer "yes" automatically to any
prompt asking the user if they want to uninstall.

> üí° **Note:** It's not uncommon for Python users to make use of "virtual
> environments." These behave like isolated installs of Python so for scientific
> or development purposes, you can be sure your code depends on exactly the
> files and libraries you want it to. Make sure you're in the correct
> environment when you're uninstalling, or nothing will happen. You can tell
> which environment has ADRpy in because you can type in the terminal:
>
>       $ pip show ADRpy
> and see ADRpy library info (as well as the installed version number).

## A 'hello world' example: atmospheric properties

There are several options for running the examples shown here: you could copy
and paste them
into a `.py` file, save it and run it in Python, or you could enter the lines,
in sequence,
at the prompt of a Python terminal. You could also copy and paste them into a
Jupyter notebook
(`.ipynb` file) cell and execute the cell.

```python
from ADRpy import atmospheres as at
from ADRpy import unitconversions as co

# Instantiate an atmosphere object: an ISA with a +10C offset
isa = at.Atmosphere(offset_deg=10)

# Query the ambient density in this model at 41,000 feet 
print("ISA+10C density at 41,000 feet (geopotential):",
      isa.airdens_kgpm3(co.ft_m(41000)), "kg/m^3")
```

You should see the following output:

    ISA+10C density at 41,000 feet (geopotential): 0.27472588853063956 kg/m^3

A design example: wing/powerplant sizing for take-off
-----------------------------------------------------

```python
# Compute the thrust to weight ratio required for take-off, given
# a basic design brief, a basic design definition and a set of 
# atmospheric conditions

from ADRpy import atmospheres as at
from ADRpy import constraintanalysis as ca
from ADRpy import unitconversions as co

# The environment: 'unusually high temperature at 5km' atmosphere
# from MIL-HDBK-310. 

# Extract the relevant atmospheric profiles...
profile_ht5_1percentile, _ = at.mil_hdbk_310('high', 'temp', 5)

# ...then use them to create an atmosphere object 
m310_ht5 = at.Atmosphere(profile=profile_ht5_1percentile)

# ====================================================================

# The take-off aspects of the design brief:
designbrief = {'rwyelevation_m': 1000, 'groundrun_m': 1200}

# Basic features of the concept:
# aspect ratio, throttle ratio 
designdefinition = {'aspectratio': 7.3}

# Initial estimates of aerodynamic performance:
designperf = {'CLTO': 0.9, 'CLmaxTO': 1.6,
              'mu_R': 0.02}  # ...and wheel rolling resistance coeff.

# An aircraft concept object can now be instantiated
concept = ca.AircraftConcept(designbrief, designdefinition,
                             designperf, m310_ht5, "Piston")

# ====================================================================

# Compute the required standard day sea level thrust/MTOW ratio reqd.
# for the target take-off performance at a range of wing loadings:
wingloadinglist_pa = [2000, 3000, 4000, 5000]

tw_sl, _ = concept.constrain_takeoff(wingloadinglist_pa)

print("Required T/W under MIL-HDBK-310 conditions:")
print("\nT/W (SL, static thrust):", tw_sl)
```

You should see the following output:

    Required T/W under MIL-HDBK-310 conditions:

    T/W (SL, static thrust): [0.40151802 0.52326939 0.64502075 0.76677211]
